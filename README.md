Tasks

Respond to GET /cats with gender, age and weight query parameters with JSON containing the filtered list of cats. E.g. GET /cats?gender=male&weight=10&age=11 will return the male cats that have weight over 10kg and are older than 11 years.

Didn't get this to work. This is the way I would've approached it adding more queries wtih '/:gender:weight:age'nod
